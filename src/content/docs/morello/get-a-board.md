The Arm Morello board is available on request, for developers to trial
the CHERI technology in a physical system. Since early 2022, several
hundred boards have been distributed to universities and companies. Most
of these boards are with organizations in the UK, but some have been
sent to other countries.

You can request a Morello board from the Digital Security by Design
programme. Simply complete this [online form](https://www.dsbd.tech/get-involved/morello-board-request/).
