## In Purecap Mode

When compiling code using purecap ABI, if you see a CHERI Clang/LLVM
warning message like this:

    warning: cast from provenance-free integer type to
    pointer type will give pointer that can not be dereferenced
    [-Wcheri-capability-misuse]

then you probably have tried to compile code that looks something like
this:

```c {3}
#include <stdint.h>

void *foo(uint64_t value) {
  return (void *)value;
}
```

The problem is that the plain integer value `value` does not have any
capability metadata associated with it. When we try to cast `value` to a
pointer, the constructed capability will have completely invalid
metadata, so the resulting capability pointer cannot be used in any
meaningful way.

### Avoiding this warning

The best way to avoid the warning is to consider why your code is
storing pointer information in a non-pointer datatype. This code must be
refactored for CHERI. Pointer values should be stored as `uintptr_t`
types, or retained as pointers directly.

An example refactoring would be:

```{.C emphasize-lines="3"}
#include <stdint.h>

void *foo(uintptr_t value) {
  return (void *)value;
}
```

which does not trigger any compiler warnings since the relevant
capability metadata is preserved in the `uintptr_t` datatype.

## In Hybrid Mode

When compiling code using hybrid ABI, if you see a CHERI Clang/LLVM
warning message like this:

    error: cast from capability type 'void * __capability' to
    non-capability type 'void *' is most likely an error;
    use __cheri_fromcap to convert between pointers and
    capabilities [-Wcheri-capability-misuse]

then you probably have tried to compile code that looks something like
this:

```{.C emphasize-lines="4"}
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void *foo(void * __capability value, ptrdiff_t offset) {
  return (void *)(value + offset);
}
```

The problem is that the pointer `value` has capability metadata
associated with it. When we try to cast `value + offset` to a
non-capability pointer `void *`, the capability metadata associated in
`value` will be lost.

### Avoiding this error

The best way to avoid the error is to consider refactoring the code so
that pointers passed around have capability metadata wherever they can
in the source code.

An example refactoring would be:

```{.C emphasize-lines="4"}
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void * __capability foo(void * __capability value, ptrdiff_t offset) {
  return value + offset;
}
```

which preserves the capability metadata.

However, in cases where it\'s not possible to return a
capability-enabled pointer, you can do an explicit cast using
`__cheri_fromcap`.

An example refactoring would be:

```{.C emphasize-lines="4"}
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void * foo(void * __capability value, ptrdiff_t offset) {
  return (__cheri_fromcap void *)(value + offset);
}
```

which allows to cast from capability-enabled pointer to a plain one.
