Sealed capabilities are a mechanism to allow a capability to be passed
between processes without the receiving process being able to forge a
capability to the same object. They serve several purposes related to
security and capability-based systems:

### Tamper-Proofing

Sealed capabilities help protect against tampering or unauthorized
modification of capabilities. Once a capability is sealed, its
properties (such as permissions and bounds) are fixed, and any
attempt to tamper with the capability will result in an invalid
capability. Check a capability is valid using `cheri_is_valid`.
Alternatively, if we try to use an invalid capability anyway, a trap will be raised. Please see the post [How do I seal a capability?](/cheri/how_to_seal)
for more details.

### Code and Control Flow Integrity

Sealed capabilities are often used to ensure the integrity of code. By sealing a code capability, you can prevent the code from being modified or replaced with malicious instructions. Also, it prevents attackers from jumping to arbitrary locations in the code.

One example is to mitigate return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. ROP attacks typically involve chaining together small snippets of existing code, known as "gadgets", to execute arbitrary code. CHERI can prevent ROP attacks by sealing automatically sealing function pointers (i.e., creating a sentry) and the return address (link register).

### Memory Safety

Sealed capabilities can be used to ensure memory safety. This can help prevent common programming errors like buffer overflows.

```c
// memory-safety.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
  int i = 0;
  char buf[4] = {'\0'};
  printf("Please input a three letter word: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  scanf("%s", buf);
  printf("buf: %#p, %s\n", buf, buf);
  printf("i: %d\n", i);
}
```

And if we compile and run the program, and type `AAAAA` when it prompts for input, we will see the following output on a CHERI system:

```shell
$ clang -march=morello \
	--target=aarch64-linux-musl_purecap \
	--sysroot=/root/musl-sysroot-purecap \
	memory-safety.c -o memory-safety -static
$ morelloie -- ./memory-safety
Please input a three letter word: AAAAA

	   sealed: (not sealed)
		flags: 0
	 exponent: 0
		  top: 0x6f8c
	   bottom: 0x6f88
Segmentation fault
```

However, if we run the same program on a non-CHERI system, we will see something similar to the following output:

```shell
$ clang -Wno-format memory-safety.c -o memory-safety
$ ./memory-safety
Please input a three letter word: AAAAA
buf: 0x16f16b2e8, AAAAA
i: 65
```

As we can see, the program on a non-CHERI system does not crash, but
it prints out the value of `i` as `65`, which is the ASCII value of
`A`. This is because the program overwrote the value of `i` with the
value of `buf`.

### Fine-Grained Access Control

Sealed capabilities can be used to implement fine-grained access
control. For example, you can seal a capability to a specific memory
region, and pass it to another process. The receiving process can
only access the memory region that the capability points to, and
cannot access any other memory regions.

```c
// access-control.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <cheriintrin.h>

#ifdef __CHERI
#define PTR_FORMAT "%#p"
#else
#define PTR_FORMAT "%p"
#endif

void untrusted_3rd_party_func(char* buf);

int main()
{
  char * message = "<secret part | public part>";
  char * public_part = strchr(message, '|') + 2;
#ifdef __CHERI
  public_part = cheri_bounds_set(public_part, strlen(public_part) + 1);
#endif
  printf("[main] message    : " PTR_FORMAT ", %s\n", message, message);
  printf("[main] public_part: " PTR_FORMAT ", %s\n", public_part, public_part);
  untrusted_3rd_party_func(public_part);
}

void untrusted_3rd_party_func(char* public_part)
{
  printf("[3rd_party_func] public_part: " PTR_FORMAT ", %s\n", public_part, public_part);
  char * secret_part = public_part;
  while (*secret_part != '<') {
	secret_part--;
  }
  printf("[3rd_party_func] secret_part: " PTR_FORMAT ", %s\n", secret_part, secret_part);
}
```

And if we compile and run the program, we will see the following
output on a CHERI system:

```shell
$ clang -march=morello \
	-D__CHERI \
	--target=aarch64-linux-musl_purecap \
	--sysroot=/root/musl-sysroot-purecap \
	access_control.c -o access_control -static
$ morelloie -- ./access_control

[3rd_party_func] public_part: 0x2002de [rR,0x2002de-0x2002eb], public part>

	  address: 0x000000000002002dd

		limit: 0x000000000002002eb
	   bounds: valid
	in bounds: false
	   length: 13
	   offset: -1

	   sealed: (not sealed)
		flags: 0
	 exponent: 0
		  top: 0x02eb
	   bottom: 0x02de

```

As we can see, the program crashes when the third-party function
tries to access the secret part of the message.
