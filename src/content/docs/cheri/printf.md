The `printf` function has been extended with support for displaying
capability values. Capability-aware `printf` re-uses the C format
specifier for pointer values, i.e. `%p`.

You can print the raw address in the capability with the `%p` specifier,
or print the address plus pretty-printed metadata with the `%#p`
variant.

```c {6-7}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  void *x = (void *)malloc(1);
  printf("The address in this capability is %p\n", x);
  printf("The full capability (incl metadata) is %#p\n", x);
}
```

This will output: :

    The address in this capability is 0x40823010
    The full capability (incl metadata) is 0x40823010 [rwRW,0x40823010-0x40823011]
