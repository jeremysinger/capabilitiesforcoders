 How do I get a Morello board?
===============================

The Arm Morello board is available on request, for developers to trial the
CHERI technology in a physical system.
Since early 2022, several hundred boards have been distributed to universities and
companies. Most of these boards are with organizations in the UK, but some
have been sent to other countries.

You can request a Morello board from the Digital Security by Design programme. Simply complete this `online form <https://www.dsbd.tech/get-involved/morello-board-request/>`_.
