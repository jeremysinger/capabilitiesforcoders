In common with other Unix variants, you can set the `LD_PRELOAD`
environment variable to point to a specific, single shared object file
that will be loaded before any other shared objects. This allows you to
override functions in the platform libraries by creating a custom
library with the same symbols and specifying the absolute path to your
library in `LD_PRELOAD`. This works for _purecap_ binaries with
_purecap_ shared objects.

For _hybrid_ binaries running with _hybrid_ shared objects, you need to
use the `LD_64_PRELOAD` environment variable instead.

In Bash,

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/customlib.so
/run/my/binary
# or for hybrid code ...
export LD_64_PRELOAD=/path/to/customlib.so
```

or for C shell:

```csh
setenv LD_PRELOAD /path/to/customlib.so
/run/my/binary
# or for hybrid code ...
setenv LD_64_PRELOAD /path/to/customlib.so
```

Note you can use the _ldd_ command with a binary to see
precisely which shared objects will be loaded.
